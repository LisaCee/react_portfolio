        <p>
          I am a full stack developer passionate about creating websites that
          remove barriers to accessing information and make that information
          readily available to everyone. I am experienced with
          HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Node and more after completing an
          intensive 13-month mastery-based program at Lambda School.
